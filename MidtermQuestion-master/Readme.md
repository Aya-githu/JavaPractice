- Make sure to add all the lib into your Library of Intellij
- Create your own repository in github --> make sure your `git remote -v` pointing to your newly created repository (if not, change using git remote set-url) --> push the code in a problem solving basis, which means once one problem is solved, add, commit & push
- Once your github repo is created, share your github url of the midterm here at --> [click me](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xa0xRvQs5ySBNhmv-eof2sYbQaxiShjqP41vdfwheio/edit?usp=sharing)

### FYI :
- You have to complete all the coding problems.
- Read the questions, there are some code here and there for you guys to explore. Try to understand them how they are working and get the best out of them.
- Feel free to google. But don't feel free to copy and paste the answer. Try to understand and implement the answers.
- I would have somebody randomly picked from the class and ask to present and explain on one problem's solution from their submission of the midterm .


# BEST OF LUCK
